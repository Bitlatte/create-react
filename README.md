# Bitlatte React
CLI tool that allows you to quickly setup new react projects.
Projects come pre configured with TypeScript Support, Vite,
React Icons, and React Router.

## Purpose
CRA (create-react-app) has become very bloated. For this reason
I wanted to have an easy way to setup new react apps without
having to go through a ton of setup each and every time.
I started by just creating a boilerplate git repo but soon
realized that a cli tool would be a much easier fit.

## Usage
To use this tool I made it very simple. All you have to do is
run the following command replacing \<project_name\> with
whatever you wish to call your project:

```sh
npx @bitlatte/react <project_name>
```

The cli tool will setup your project and give you the next steps
to get up and running in no time.
